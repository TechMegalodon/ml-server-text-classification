Newsgroups: comp.sys.mac.system From: probulf@Informatik.TU-Muenchen.DE (Frank Probul) Subject: Re: A/ROSE with Centris and Quadra models Organization: Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Germany Date: Mon, 19 Apr 1993 14:33:26 GMT A/ROSE = Apple Real Time Operating System Environment This is a system extension for these NuBUS cards using the MCP (= Macintosh Coprocessor Platform). The MCP-cards are NuBUS cards with a Motorola 68000-Processor and 512 KB RAM (expandable to 1 Meg). MCP is a development platform for hardware-designers so they can use a card with an own processor and thus the main processor isn't needed for these cards. Currently the only cards I know are - the Apple TokenRing-Card - the new Apple Ethernet-Card - the Apple NuBUS serial card Perhaps there are some third-party-cards, but I don't know. --------------------------------------------- Frank Probul Emanuelstr. 17, D-8000 Munich 40, Germany AppleLink: Probul.F@AppleLink.Apple.COM internet: probulf@informatik.tu-muenchen.de Munich University of Technology Department of Computer Science Germany ---------------------------------------------	14615

Let me clue you in on this newsgroup. t.p.m is populated largely by people whose hatred for the U.S. government, especially the government of Mr. Clinton, is literally boundless. To these people, the suggestion that agents of the U.S. government would carry out a spectacular massacre of its own citizens, in full view of TV cameras, is not an 'extraordinary claim'. It's just another day in the life of these United States. They don't have to suggest any reason why the FBI would want to publicly massacre citizens. Have you seen 'The Crying Game'?

And won't they have to change their name to the ""Steelers"" or something. The only significant deposits of oil around Hamilton are those caused by the tire fire a few years back. Then again if the NBA can have the Utah Jazz or the L.A. Lakers (think about it, what lakes are in L.A.) then I guess the NHL can have the Hamilton Oilers."	14618

7	Emergency Brake on '86 Nissan Maxima	Just a quick, simple question really... How many wheels are affected by the emergency brake on an '86 Nissan Maxima. I've heard that all four are affected, but this would seem unusual to me. I thought the emergency brake on most cars only affected the rear wheels. Also, how powerful is the emergency brake usually? Enough to lock wheels at 30mph? Hmmmm... I just have to wonder about some of the things I hear... Outatime ------->	14620

The 2nd part is rendered null and void by the simple fact that I do know several ""strong"" atheists. I am sure that others do. I myself am ""strong"" in the sense that I find the standard concept of God without any meaning. Any attempt to bring meaning either results in the destruction of the viability of language, or in internal self contradiction. The concept of strong atheism is not just a whimsical fantasy.
